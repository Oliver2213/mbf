		Args:
			scheduler: A reffrence to a scheduler object so a job can be added.
				This should be automatically provided by mbf's 'timer' method, so you shouldn't need to worry about this.
			type: the type of apscheduler trigger that this job or "timer" should use. Is 'interval' by default.
				Note that this will cause the associated function to be run over and over ever n, n being the user-defined interval.
				Can be one of 'interval', 'date', or 'cron'.
			enabled: If this timer should be enabled when created. If set to false, it will immediately be paused.
			name: The name of this timer. Set to none by default, the 'timer' decorator will set this to the name of the decorated function. If this particular function will be run by more than one timer, customize this for each one.
				This is actually apscheduler's 'id' attribute, but I've renamed it name because it's more in line with what triggers use.
			group: The group that this timer instance belongs to. Set to 'all' by default
			one_shot: Specifies that this timer should run only once, and then be removed. If the type arg is set to 'date', one_shot is implicitly true. If run_limit is set to 1, this flag is also set.
			run_limit: the number of times to run the associated function before the timer is removed. This is -1 by default, which means no limit.
		Any extra args and keyword args are passed to APScheduler's 'create_job' method.

		"""This class represents a trigger and it's metadata;
			It does not store code, as it's intended that a function in mbf will "decorate" user functions with a trigger class,
		Arguments:
			trig: Either a regular expression (prefered) or a plain text string (which will be matched literally)
			is_regexp: A boolean that specifies if the trigger argument is a regular expression (and if it's a string it will be compiled), or just a plain text string (which will be left alone and matched literally)
			case_sensitive: A bool, true by default, that specifies if the trigger will match characters in exact case.
				When this is false, regular expressions have the 'IGNORECASE' mode set; for strings, the trig value is 'lower()'-ed on instantiation, the incoming line is 'lower()'-ed as well and then processed.
			multiline: If this trigger should match on multiple lines.
			name: A string (none by default) that is the human readable name for the trigger.
				The name is set by default by mbf's 'trigger' method which wrapps the trigger's code; unless set otherwise it will become the name of the trigger's function.
			enabled: A boolean that determines if this trigger will be considered when matching lines.
				Triggers can be disabled when created, and when required, enabled by other code when needed.
			stop_processing: A bool, false by default, that tells the parser to stop firing triggers after this one.
			sequence: An integer (100 by default) that is used to determine the order in which triggers will be fired.
				Triggers will be fired from lowest sequence to highest; if any trigger tells the parser to stop firing, no more triggers (no matter their sequence) will be fired afterwards for that specific buffer of data.

				For multiline triggers, this is the entire block of text that was pulled from the socket and passed to fire.
				For single line triggers, whether regexp or plaintext, this will be the single line that it matched in.
				If your trigger is multiline, this may be a large chunk of text; triggers using regular expressions will have a much easier time of parsing their line(s) from this data.
			match - If the trigger uses a regular expression, this will be it's corresponding match object. If the trigger is a plaintext string, this will be none.
